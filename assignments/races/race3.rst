Race 3
======================

**Track:** Choose a new track that is different from Race 1 and Race 2. This track should also be large and wide enough to accomodate two vehicles racing head to head. We use these `tubes <https://www.walmart.com/ip/5-Sizes-White-Flexible-Air-Conditioner-Exhaust-Tube-Pipe-Vent-Hose-Air-Conditioning-Tube/825717438?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=101012893&adid=22222222227329295495&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=412282371098&wl4=aud-430887228898:pla-925803589197&wl5=9007284&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=144521308&wl11=online&wl12=825717438&veh=sem&gclid=Cj0KCQjwsYb0BRCOARIsAHbLPhHJtcPE75Wqdcs7O8stQxn1h_VyjQvBEmq7l4-gpG0gtLNSNg6uMkUaAk9cEALw_wc>`_ to set up our track. It is soft enough that crashes will not damange the vehicle. Laser cut these `holders <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nt0ZO4beQ2dVvx_JtG515-q1HvWNrgP5?usp=sharing>`_ so the track will stay in place. Students will be mapping this track so you do not want it to change.

**Race Prep:** Teams should be given the track beforehand so they can map it on their own time.

**Race Day:** View the `Race3 Rubric <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TVz_E3AGdg7vMDc3E5JCkMwy_1bnrjuo5goGEVQUQB8/edit#gid=0>`_ and :ref:`Grading <doc_grading>` to see how teams are evaluated. Depending on how much time is allocated, there can be a practice sesion beforehand and then have teams do one or two heats of timed trials similar to Race 1 and Race 2 in order for the final race to be seeded. Alternatively, the timed trials for seeding can be done the day before.
