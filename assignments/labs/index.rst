Labs
==================

Labs are where most of the learning occurs. This is when students have the chance to take what they learned in lecture and apply it to a given problem. There are 8 labs total. Students have 1 to 1.5 week depending on the lab to complete the assignment.

Labs 1-4 are **INDIVIDUAL** assignments and Labs 5-9 are **GROUP** assignments. Students should be placed in teams of 4 ideally with members that have different skill sets.

.. tip:: Set up a `Piazza page <https://piazza.com/>`_ for the class so students can ask questions freely.

All the code for the labs can be found on the `F1TENTH_labs Github Repository <https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_labs>`_. Each lab folder contains the the latex source file for the handout, latex student solution template, and any skeleton codes required. 

The sections below have information for each lab.
